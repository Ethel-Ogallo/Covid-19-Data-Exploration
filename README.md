# Covid-19-Data-Exploration  
An exploratory data analysis that aims to provide insights into the impact of the pandemic thus gaining a comprehensive understanding of 
the Covid-19 situation worldwide and its impact in Kenya in terms of deaths, new cases, testing and vaccinations. 
  
The Key Highlights of the analysis include: 
### Global Impact of Covid 19:Deaths and Infection  
The global impact of Covid-19  has been very significant with 767 million cases reported and of that 6.9 million deaths.This brings about
a death rate of about 0.9% globally.  
The diseases' distribution across the globe is also significant in that China, where patient zero was recorded, surprsisingly does not
have the highest death count and infections recorded in the world till date. This record is held by the USA which recorded 103.4 million
infected and 1.1million deaths.This could be attributes the quick response the Chinese governemnt took to control the spread by frequent 
testing, quarantining and rollling out vaccinations to every citizen.  
### Covid-19 Impact on Kenya  
**The Evolution of Covid-19 in Kenya: Reported cases and deaths**  
With a focus on Kenya, this is the evolution of covid 19 pandemic in terms of cases and deaths reported over a period of three years
from the begning of the pandemic 2020 January to June 2023 .Kenya reported about 5000 deaths and 300,000 cases throughout this period.
Covid-19 Evolution in Kenya was such that the cases reported started at about June 2020 and increasing steadily and quicky upto February
2022 where cases recorded stagnated or rather new cases reported was very minimal.This was around the same time the government of Kenya
started rolling out vaccines. Kenya did not record a very high death count compared to the population.  
### Testing and Vaccination Efforts in Kenya  
As reported by WHO, Kenya has reported about 1.5 million people tested as the maximum in February 2022 and recorded a positive test rate
at 0.2% in August 2021. The number of tests conducted is steadily increasing with some months having no tests reported between
June 2021-November 2021. Of the rolling covid-19 tests conducted, the positive test rate fluctuates every month.Kenya's effort to test 
and vaccinate its people against Covid-19 disease is moderatley impactful Kenya reported 20% of teh population as being fully vaccinated 
and only 3% received booster shots.With a population of about 54 million,the numbers are not as high as one would deem ideal however
vaccination is still ongoing.
